# Case Study: Bike-share Company
In this case study, I will perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share company (Cyclistic) in order to help them attract more riders. 

## Task Statement:
Analyze historical data to find differences between annual members and casual riders. Based on the analysis provide three recommendations for marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Data Prep:
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. [Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data

>  The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company.The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) This is public data that I can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.
